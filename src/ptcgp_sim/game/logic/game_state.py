# Responsibility: To be the single, authoritative container for the entire current state of a single game match. It holds references to the players, the current turn number, whose turn it is, etc. It should be easily serializable (convertible to JSON), which is a massive benefit for saving/loading games, replays, and debugging.
# Why it's standard: It creates a "single source of truth." The GameController and RuleEngine act upon the GameState but don't own it. This makes your logic much cleaner and easier to testâ€”you can create a GameState object representing a specific scenario and pass it to your logic functions.
